# CIS 3120 Final Project
## By: Faraj Arvid

### [API Documentation](https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3)

### Project Purpose and Functionality
The purpose of my final project is to build an API-driven application that integrates data analysis, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and visualizations to analyze 
football/soccer data. My chosen API was API-FOOTBALL, an API that offers extensive data on football leagues, teams, players, etc. I chose this API because it merges my
big passion for football and my keen interest in data and analytics.

This project allows me to apply the data analysis skills I developed this semester to take metrics/data and transform them into digestible information and charts. Through 
the API, I strive to analyze both team and player performance, visualize trends, and then determine whether the data aligns with the "eye test" (watching matches). 
Similarly, I want to make sure my analysis is thorough by exploring the context and limitations of the data, allowing for a better interpretation of the results.
